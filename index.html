        <p>I've been programming since I was 13 years old. Throughout the following years since, I've worked with Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, C++, and YAML.</p>
            <p>I believe that being self-taught in any field exposes you to how you really learn and prepares you for how you're going to have to learn for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, in 2019, I decided I wanted to get a proper hands-on education after learning on my own and bring myself up to a level where I can be competitive against anyone else in the industry. </p>
            <p>Upon completing this program, I am certain I will be able to stand out in the industry, be equipped to solve any problem, and master my ability to learn at a rapid pace.</p>
